Person Recognition and Identification Robot using Raspberry Pi.
Developed using image processing techniques. This project can detect registered individuals in real-time. 
Technologies used:
1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. Dlib (for face recognition)
4. Flask (for the web interface & API endpoints)
5. SQLite (for storing user data & face encodings)
6. Raspberry Pi 4B
7. Arduino (for motor control & physical robot movement)
